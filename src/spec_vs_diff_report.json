  "summary": "The diff implements a browser download flow for the plain-text UI translations by importing the exact `ui-texts.txt` content as a raw string and exposing a download control in the Footer. It also updates the workflow documentation with UI steps, repo source mapping, and expected filename. No clear requirement gaps are evident from the provided diff summary.",
