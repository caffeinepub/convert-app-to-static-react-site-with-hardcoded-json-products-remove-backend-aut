  "summary": "Implemented a reusable AABoxes pink token in CSS and exposed it to Tailwind, then conditionally applied it as the background for all non-home routes via the root layout. However, the diff provides no verifiable evidence that the chosen pink was sampled from image-12.png, and it appears to include multiple unrelated UI/content changes outside the stated scope/non-goals.",
